## Basic Portal

This repository contains a basic attendance portal developed using HTML and CSS. The aim of this project is to provide a simple yet functional interface for accessing school or college-related information. 


### Future Development:
While the current version of the portal serves as a foundation, there are plans to further enhance its functionality. Some of the proposed improvements include:
- **Integration with a Server**: Adding a server-side component to store and manage data such as student records, teacher details, and administrative information.
- **User Authentication**: Implementing user authentication to allow access to specific sections of the portal based on user roles (e.g., admin, teacher, student).
- **Enhanced Admin Panel**: Creating an admin panel to manage user accounts, courses, events, and other relevant data.
- **Teacher Portal**: Developing a separate portal for teachers to manage their classes, assignments, and communication with students.
- **Institutional Use Readiness**: Making the portal robust and scalable for deployment in educational institutions, ensuring reliability and security.
